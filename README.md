Just got out of the theater and wow, my mind's a bit of a jumble. Riff Raff — it's like waking up in the middle of a dream and you can’t tell what's real and what’s still sleep clinging to your brain. Maybe it's the popcorn haze. I swear, I still feel that stranger's elbow jabbing into my back and someone's phone lit up every five damn minutes. Should’ve told you to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   — at least rewind the madness. 

So yeah the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮… man, it’s got that raw grit. Like if Guy Ritchie met a Picasso painting, and they decided to throw a party in a London squat filled with voices that don't match faces. There’s this one scene — like I swear the smell of rain was seeping off the screen, that musty, damp tingling. The lead guy, he’s got a face like a map of the city — creases and all, the way he moves is all jerky, like a marionette on tangled strings.

> How could I forget the music — clumsy at times, deliberate like, I dunno, a cat playing Beethoven with its paws. Why does it work so well?? It's like trying to drink soup with a fork but somehow it fills you up perfectly. And I dunno why but it made me want spaghetti. Weird. Someone asked me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, and I probably will, just to catch the bits that slipped away, like sand through fingers. 

There were these random subplots too, weaving in out like somebody stitched them with invisible thread. My head's spinning with the echoes still, the voices stuck like chewing gum to my shoe sole. Also, the woman in the red coat — did she ever say a word? Or was she just the color? 

Wish you could have been there. Typing this feels like trying to sketch a rainbow with a broken crayon. I've just noticed popcorn crumbs stuck to my shirt — a souvenir.
